RILnet
======

A Compact Framework wrapper for Microsoft RIL (Radio Interface layer), based on https://rilnet.codeplex.com/ which did not change since 2009.

Using the RIL is a bit complicated as it has to be used asynchronously. Your code isseus a request and get's a notification with the result (or not).

See demo code for usage of the wrapper.
